/// <summary>
/// Abstraction over an asynchronous exact-search probe service (PICKET's probe farm): an
/// in-process engine pool, an external-process adapter, or a test double. A probe answers
/// "what does a real search say about this position, and about this move in particular",
/// and nothing here presumes how it arrives at the answer.
///
/// Contract:
///  - SubmitProbe never blocks and never throws for capacity reasons; it returns false when the
///    request cannot be accepted (queue full, source unavailable), in which case no result will
///    be delivered for it. The caller treats false as a silent no-op.
///  - Each accepted request produces EXACTLY ONE invocation of the completion callback supplied
///    at session start (including for cancellations, with Completed == false), on an arbitrary
///    thread. The callback must therefore only enqueue; it must never touch the caller's graph.
///  - BeginSession/EndSession bracket one MCGS search (one move). EndSession cancels all
///    outstanding requests of the session; late results after EndSession are dropped by the
///    source (never delivered).
///  - A source may host multiple concurrent sessions (one per concurrent search, as when a
///    tournament plays several games in one process). Each result is routed to the session that
///    submitted it, and ending one session leaves the others untouched.

/// state (network weights, worker threads, transposition table) to be shared process-wide
/// while everything genuinely per-search stays isolated. Concurrent searches therefore share
